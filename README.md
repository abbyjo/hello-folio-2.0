# Portfolio 2.0

## Description
This page was created to showcase my projects as well as to provide an information hub for people looking to contact me.
As an upgraded version of my previous portfolio I also believe this app can show more of my current skillset as well.
Creating this app allowed me to become more familiar with Vite, React and Netlify!

## Installation
N/A 

## Usage 

Visit the deployed page [here](https://hello-folio.netlify.app/)!
You can click the links at the very top to navigate to different sections.
The "Portfolio" section is full of images that upon clicking will take you to the deployed app or the app's GitHub repo.
The "Contact" section has a form in which you can leave your name, a valid email address and a message.
Please note: at present the form does not connect to a back end and so messages are not sent or saved.
The "Resume" section contains a brief overview of my skills as well as a link to my complete resume which can be downloaded or shared through Google Docs.
If viewing this page on your desktop you can hover over the links for a little surprise!‚≠ê
